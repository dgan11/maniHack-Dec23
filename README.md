# Hackathon 2023 App Templates
Template repo for getting you started on developing a Studio App using the newest V3 Content Framework!

# üöÄ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## ‚ö°Ô∏è start

```
yarn dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.

## üëÄ view dev build

This app is meant to run in an iframe inside of Manifold Studio CMS. To see it, choose "Development URL" when opening your app from the Developer panel. You'll be taken to the page that will serve your local app instead of production files.

Hot reloading is enabled, so the app should just reload whenever you make changes while `yarn dev` is running. That being said, it can be a little flaky at times so always triple check.


## ü¶æ build

```
yarn build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## üß∂ lint

```
yarn lint
```

or

```
yarn lint:fix
```

Creates a `.eslintcache` file in which ESLint cache is stored. Running this command can dramatically improve ESLint's running time by ensuring that only changed files are linted.

Also does some minor formatting.
